# Penetration Testing Tools

One handy repo containing all the latest bleeding edge [penetration testing](https://www.aptive.co.uk/penetration-testing/) tools, if you want a tool added to this repo - I accept push requests or you can leave me a comment and I'll add it. 

I appreciate Kali Linux has most of the penetration testing tools available within this repo, however I often have a subset of pen testing tools that live under **~/Tools** used in addition for bleeding edge version or tools that have not yest found their way into Kali.   

## Installation 

git clone https://github.com/Arr0way/penetration-testing-tools.git
