# Penetration Testing Tools

One handy repo containing all the latest and greatest [penetration testing](https://www.aptive.co.uk/penetration-testing/) tools, if you want you'd like to see a tool added to this repo - I accept push requests. I appreciate Kali Linux has most of these tools available, however I often have a subset of pen testing tools that live under **~/Tools** that I use in addition to the Kali binaries - for bleeding edge version or tools that have not yest found their way into Kali yet.   

## Installation 

git clone
